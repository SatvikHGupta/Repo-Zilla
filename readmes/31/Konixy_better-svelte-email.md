## Usage

See the [documentation](https://better-svelte-email.konixy.dev/docs) for a complete guide on how to use Better Svelte Email.

## Features

- **Tailwind v4 Support** - Transforms Tailwind classes to inline styles for email clients
- **Built-in Email Preview** - Visual email preview and test sending
- **TypeScript First** - Fully typed with comprehensive type definitions
- **Well Tested** - >90% test coverage with unit and integration tests

_See [Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) for future features and planned improvements._

## Why?

Existing Svelte email solutions have significant limitations:

- **svelte-email** hasn't been updated in over 2 years
- **svelte-email-tailwind** suffers from stability issues and maintaining it is not sustainable anymore

Better Svelte Email is a complete rewrite of [svelte-email-tailwind](https://github.com/steveninety/svelte-email-tailwind) inspired by [React Email](https://react.email/), providing the rock-solid foundation your email infrastructure needs. It brings the simplicity, reliability, and feature richness of [React Email](https://react.email/) to the Svelte ecosystem.

## Minimum Svelte Version

The minimum supported Svelte version is 5.14.3.
For older versions, you can use [`svelte-email-tailwind`](https://github.com/steveninety/svelte-email-tailwind).

## Supported Features

### ✅ Supported

- All tailwindcss v4 utilities
- Custom Tailwind classes (`bg-[#fff]`, `my:[40px]`, ...)
- Dynamic Tailwind classes (`class={someVar}`)
- Responsive breakpoints (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`, `2xl:`)
- HTML elements and Svelte components
- Nested components
- All svelte features such as each blocks (`{#each}`) and if blocks (`{#if}`), and more
- Custom Tailwind configurations
- Custom CSS injection (for app theme integration)
