## The Question

In 2025, AI agents gained the ability to manipulate the real world — through [Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills), [MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), and tool use. Claude can now run code, query databases, control browsers, and execute complex scientific workflows. ChatGPT can browse the web, write and run programs, analyze data. Gemini can see, hear, and interact with the physical world.

**AI got its skill tree. But what about humans?**

- A 35-year-old professional realizes their degree is becoming obsolete. How do they catch up?
- A 10-year-old will graduate into a world where AI does most knowledge work. What should they learn?
- A PhD student spends 5 years mastering a narrow field. Was that the right investment?
- A first-generation college student has no mentors. Who teaches them the unwritten rules?

These are not hypothetical questions. They are **the** questions of our time.

## The Insight

Here's what we know from the latest research:

> **AI tutoring dramatically improves learning, but only with pedagogical guardrails.** A large-scale randomized controlled trial published in *PNAS* found that GPT-4-based tutoring improved high school math performance by 48–127%. Without structured pedagogical design, students became dependent on AI and showed reduced skill acquisition. Carefully designed guardrails (providing hints instead of answers) restored learning gains.
>
> — [Bastani et al. (2025), *PNAS*, 122(26)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2422633122)

> **Spaced repetition and active recall are the most effective learning techniques known to science.** A meta-analysis of 242 studies with 169,000+ participants confirmed that practice testing and distributed practice outperform all other methods, including re-reading, highlighting, and summarizing.
>
> — [Dunlosky et al. (2013), *Psychological Science in the Public Interest*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1529100612453266); [Donoghue & Hattie (2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895)

> **Algorithmically optimized spaced repetition dramatically enhances human learning.** A study published in *PNAS* analyzing data from 12 million Duolingo learners demonstrated that computationally optimized review schedules significantly outperform heuristic methods, enabling learners to memorize more material in less time.
>
> — [Tabibian et al. (2019), *PNAS*, 116(10), 3988–3993](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1815156116)

The science is clear: **AI + cognitive science = the most powerful learning combination in human history.** The gap? AI agents have no built-in pedagogical structure. They know everything but teach nothing.

**Human Skill Tree fills that gap.**

**AI:** Let's debug this together. Before I look at the answer:

Try adding a `print(i, arr[i])` inside the loop — what do you see?

## 🔥 Learning AI in the Age of AI

The most meta question of our time: **how do you learn about AI, using AI?**

### Three Layers of AI Literacy

```
Layer 3: BUILD with AI     → Prompt engineering, fine-tuning, RAG, agents, MCP development
Layer 2: WORK with AI      → Using ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini/Copilot/DeepSeek as daily tools
Layer 1: THINK about AI    → What AI is, how it works, what it can't do, ethics, society
```

**Layer 1 — AI Fundamentals** (everyone needs this):
- What is machine learning? What are LLMs? How do they actually work?
- What can AI do well? What can't it do? Where does it hallucinate?
- Ethics: bias, privacy, job displacement, deepfakes, alignment
- Critical thinking: evaluating AI outputs, detecting errors, verifying claims

**Layer 2 — AI as a Daily Tool** (professionals & students):
- Prompt engineering: how to get better outputs from any AI
- Using AI for writing, coding, research, analysis, creativity
- AI-assisted learning: using AI as a Socratic tutor (this project!)
- Workflow integration: AI + your existing tools and processes

**Layer 3 — Building AI** (developers & researchers):
- Machine learning fundamentals: supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement
- Deep learning: neural networks, transformers, attention mechanisms
- LLM application development: APIs, function calling, RAG, fine-tuning
- Agent development: Skills, MCP servers, tool use, multi-agent systems
- AI safety and alignment research

> **The paradox**: The best way to learn AI is to use AI to learn about AI. Human Skill Tree provides the pedagogical structure that makes this self-referential loop actually work.

## Philosophy

### Why "Skill Tree"?

In RPGs, a skill tree is a branching structure where you unlock abilities by investing points. Real life works the same way — prerequisites matter, multiple paths exist, specialization is valid, and you can always respec.

### Why Social Intelligence?

No other AI skill project covers **人情世故** — the art of navigating human relationships. Yet this is arguably the most important skill set for success in life. AI can be a safe space to practice these skills through scenario simulation.

### Why Learning Science?

Most AI tutoring is "ask a question, get an answer." This creates the **illusion of learning** — you feel like you understand, but forget within days. Our skills are designed around how memory actually works: test before tell, space it out, make it hard, connect it, apply it.

# 🌳 人类技能树

### AI 时代的人类学习操作系统 · 人类养成记

*AI 通过 Skill 和 MCP 获得了操纵现实的能力。人类呢？*

</div>

---

## 这个时代的问题

2025 年，AI 智能体通过 Skill、MCP 和工具调用，获得了操控现实世界的能力。Claude 能运行代码、查询数据库、控制浏览器。ChatGPT 能联网搜索、写代码、分析数据。Gemini 能看、能听、能与物理世界交互。

**AI 有了自己的技能树。人类呢？**

- 一个 35 岁的职场人发现自己的学位正在过时。怎么赶上？
- 一个 2026 年出生的孩子，成年时 AI 已无处不在。该学什么？
- 一个博士生花 5 年钻研一个窄领域。这笔投资对吗？
- 一个农村来的大学生没有人脉、没有导师。谁来教他那些不成文的规则？

这些不是假设性的问题。这是**我们这个时代最核心的问题**。

## 洞察

最新研究告诉我们：

> **AI 辅导可大幅提升学习效果，但前提是有教学结构。** 发表在 *PNAS* 上的大规模随机对照试验发现：GPT-4 辅导使高中数学成绩提升 48–127%，但缺乏教学设计时学生会依赖 AI，技能习得反而下降。精心设计的教学引导（给提示而非答案）才能恢复学习效果。
>
> — [Bastani et al. (2025), *PNAS*](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2422633122)

> **间隔重复和主动回忆是科学已知最有效的学习方法。** 一项涵盖 242 项研究、169,000+ 参与者的 Meta 分析证实：练习测试和分散练习的效果超过所有其他方法。
>
> — [Dunlosky et al. (2013)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1529100612453266); [Donoghue & Hattie (2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895)

科学结论很清晰：**AI + 认知科学 = 人类历史上最强大的学习组合。** 问题在于，AI 智能体没有内置的教学结构。它们什么都知道，但什么都不会教。

**人类技能树填补这个缺口。**

---

## 这是什么

一套 **33 个即装即用的 AI 智能体技能**，能将 ChatGPT、Claude、Gemini、Copilot、DeepSeek 或任何兼容 AI 转化为**结构化、基于科学的学习伙伴**。

这是对 **AI 与想要学习的人类互动方式的升级**。

| 一刀切 | 无结构 | 自适应 + 结构化 |
| 被动（阅读/听讲） | 问答式 | 主动回忆、间隔重复、苏格拉底对话 |
| 单一学科 | 什么都知道，什么都不会教 | K-12 到职业的精选路径 |

## 🔥 在 AI 时代学习 AI

最 meta 的问题：**如何用 AI 学习 AI？**

```
第3层: 用 AI 构建     → 提示词工程、微调、RAG、Agent 开发、MCP 开发
第2层: 用 AI 工作     → 用 ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini/Copilot/DeepSeek 作为日常工具
第1层: 理解 AI        → AI 是什么、怎么工作、不能做什么、伦理、社会影响
```

**悖论**：学 AI 最好的方式就是用 AI 学 AI。人类技能树提供了让这个自指循环真正有效的教学结构。

## 基于学习科学

每个技能都运用认知科学原理——不仅是教**什么**，更是**人脑如何学习和记忆**：

| 原理 | 机制 | 证据 |
|------|------|------|
| 🔄 **间隔重复** | 以最优间隔对抗遗忘曲线 | Meta 分析：242 项研究，169K+ 参与者 |
| 🧪 **主动回忆** | 检索练习使记忆强度提升 10 倍 | Roediger & Butler (2011) |
| 🎯 **适度困难** | 短期挣扎 → 长期保留 | Bjork & Bjork (2011) |
| 🔀 **交叉练习** | 混合主题培养辨别能力 | Pan et al. (2018) |
| 🖼️ **双重编码** | 文字 + 视觉 = 更强编码 | Paivio (1991) |
| 🪞 **苏格拉底法** | 提问 > 给答案，深度理解 | Chi et al. (2001) |
| 🧩 **组块化** | 将信息分组为有意义的单元 | Miller (1956) |
| 📊 **布鲁姆分类** | 6 个认知层次：记忆 → 创造 | Anderson & Krathwohl (2001) |

## 设计理念

### 为什么叫「技能树」？

在 RPG 游戏里，技能树是通过投入点数解锁能力的分支结构。现实也一样——有前置条件、多条路径、专精是有效的，而且你随时可以重新分配。

### 为什么要做社交智慧？

没有其他 AI 技能项目覆盖**人情世故**——驾驭人际关系的艺术。然而这可以说是人生成功最重要的技能。AI 可以通过场景模拟，成为练习这些技能的安全空间。

### 为什么要基于学习科学？

大多数 AI 辅导是"问个问题，得个答案"。这制造了**学习的幻觉**——你感觉自己懂了，但几天内就忘了。我们的技能围绕记忆的真实运作方式设计：先测再教、分散复习、制造适度困难、建立联系、实际应用。
