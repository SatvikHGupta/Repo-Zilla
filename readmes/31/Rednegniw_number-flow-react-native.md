## Features

- **Beautiful digit-by-digit rolling**: each digit animates independently via virtual wheels with automatic direction detection
- **Two renderers**: a default View-based renderer with zero dependencies, and a Skia renderer if you need to have Skia numbers animating
- **Full Intl.NumberFormat**: currencies, percentages, units, compact notation, and everything that this beautiful formatter has to offer
- **TimeFlow**: dedicated animated time display with 12h/24h, timestamps, and countdown support. Even supports centiseconds.
- **120 FPS scrubbing**: worklet-driven updates entirely on the UI thread, with Skia.
- **37 numeral systems**: Arabic-Indic, Devanagari, Thai, CJK, and more.
- **Accessibility**: VoiceOver/TalkBack announcements + reduce motion support
- **Continuous mode**: odometer-style cascading digit rolls

## Installation

```bash
# npm
npm install number-flow-react-native react-native-reanimated

# bun
bun add number-flow-react-native react-native-reanimated

# expo
npx expo install number-flow-react-native react-native-reanimated
```

## Quick start

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { NumberFlow } from "number-flow-react-native";

function PriceDisplay() {
  const [price, setPrice] = useState(42.99);

  return (
    <NumberFlow
      value={price}
      format={{ style: "currency", currency: "USD" }}
      style={{ fontSize: 32, color: "#000" }}
    />
  );
}
```

## Renderers

The default import uses the **View-based renderer**, with no extra dependencies needed. If you need to display numbers in Skia Canvas, use the **Skia renderer**:

```tsx
// View-based (default)
import { NumberFlow, TimeFlow } from "number-flow-react-native";

// Skia canvas (requires @shopify/react-native-skia)
import { SkiaNumberFlow, SkiaTimeFlow, useSkiaFont } from "number-flow-react-native/skia";
```
