# npcpy

`npcpy` is a flexible agent framework for building AI applications and conducting research with LLMs. It supports local and cloud providers, multi-agent teams, tool calling, image/audio/video generation, knowledge graphs, fine-tuning, and more.

```bash
pip install npcpy
```

## Quick Examples

### Create and use personas

```python
from npcpy import NPC

simon = NPC(
    name='Simon Bolivar',
    primary_directive='Liberate South America from the Spanish Royalists.',
    model='gemma3:4b',
    provider='ollama'
)
response = simon.get_llm_response("What is the most important territory to retain in the Andes?")
print(response['response'])

```

### Direct LLM call

```python
from npcpy import get_llm_response

response = get_llm_response("Who was the celtic messenger god?", model='qwen3:4b', provider='ollama')
print(response['response'])
# or use ollama's cloud models

test = get_llm_response('who is john wick', model='minimax-m2.7:cloud', provider='ollama',)

print(test['response'])
```

### Agent with tools

```python
from npcpy import Agent, ToolAgent, CodingAgent

# Agent — comes with default tools (sh, python, edit_file, web_search, etc.)
agent = Agent(name='ops', model='qwen3.5:2b', provider='ollama')
print(agent.run("Find all Python files over 500 lines in this repo and list them"))

# ToolAgent — add your own tools alongside defaults
import subprocess

def run_tests(test_path: str = "tests/") -> str:
    """Run pytest on the given path and return results."""
    result = subprocess.run(["python3", "-m", "pytest", test_path, "-v", "--tb=short"],
                            capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=120)
    return result.stdout + result.stderr

def git_diff(branch: str = "main") -> str:
    """Show the git diff against a branch."""
    result = subprocess.run(["git", "diff", branch, "--stat"], capture_output=True, text=True)
    return result.stdout

reviewer = ToolAgent(
    name='code_reviewer',
    primary_directive='You review code changes, run tests, and report issues.',
    tools=[run_tests, git_diff],
    model='qwen3.5:2b', provider='ollama'
)
print(reviewer.run("Run the tests and summarize any failures"))

# CodingAgent — auto-executes code blocks from LLM responses
coder = CodingAgent(name='coder', language='python', model='qwen3.5:2b', provider='ollama')
print(coder.run("Write a script that finds duplicate files by hash in the current directory"))
```

### Streaming

```python
from npcpy import get_llm_response

response = get_llm_response("Explain quantum entanglement.", model='qwen3.5:2b', provider='ollama', stream=True)
for chunk in response['response']:
    print(chunk.get('message', {}).get('content', ''), end='', flush=True)
```

### JSON output

Include the expected JSON structure in your prompt. With `format='json'`, the response is auto-parsed — `response['response']` is already a dict or list.

```python
from npcpy import get_llm_response

response = get_llm_response(
    '''List 3 planets from the sun.
    Return JSON: {"planets": [{"name": "planet name", "distance_au": 0.0, "num_moons": 0}]}''',
    model='qwen3.5:2b', provider='ollama',
    format='json'
)
for planet in response['response']['planets']:
    print(f"{planet['name']}: {planet['distance_au']} AU, {planet['num_moons']} moons")

response = get_llm_response(
    '''Analyze this review: 'The battery life is amazing but the screen is too dim.'
    Return JSON: {"tone": "positive/negative/mixed", "key_phrases": ["phrase1", "phrase2"], "confidence": 0.0}''',
    model='qwen3.5:2b', provider='ollama',
    format='json'
)
result = response['response']
print(result['tone'], result['key_phrases'])
```

### Pydantic structured output

Pass a Pydantic model and the JSON schema is sent to the LLM directly.

```python
from npcpy import get_llm_response
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List

class Planet(BaseModel):
    name: str
    distance_au: float
    num_moons: int

class SolarSystem(BaseModel):
    planets: List[Planet]

response = get_llm_response(
    "List the first 4 planets from the sun.",
    model='qwen3.5:2b', provider='ollama',
    format=SolarSystem
)
for p in response['response']['planets']:
    print(f"{p['name']}: {p['distance_au']} AU, {p['num_moons']} moons")
```

### Image, audio, and video generation

```python
from npcpy.llm_funcs import gen_image, gen_video
from npcpy.gen.audio_gen import text_to_speech

# Image — OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, or diffusers
images = gen_image("A sunset over the mountains", model='gpt-image-1', provider='openai')
images[0].save("sunset.png")

# Audio — OpenAI, Gemini, ElevenLabs, Kokoro, gTTS
audio_bytes = text_to_speech("Hello from npcpy!", engine="openai", voice="alloy")
with open("hello.wav", "wb") as f:
    f.write(audio_bytes)

# Video — Gemini Veo
result = gen_video("A cat riding a skateboard", model='veo-3.1-fast-generate-preview', provider='gemini')
print(result['output'])
```

### Multi-agent team

```python
from npcpy import NPC, Team

team = Team(team_path='./npc_team')
result = team.orchestrate("Analyze the latest sales data and draft a report")
print(result['output'])
```

Or define a team in code:

```python
from npcpy import NPC, Team

coordinator = NPC(name='lead', primary_directive='Coordinate the team. Delegate to @analyst and @writer.')
analyst = NPC(name='analyst', primary_directive='Analyze data. Provide numbers and trends.', model='gemini-2.5-flash', provider='gemini')
writer = NPC(name='writer', primary_directive='Write clear reports from analysis.', model='qwen3:8b', provider='ollama')

team = Team(npcs=[coordinator, analyst, writer], forenpc='lead')
result = team.orchestrate("What are the trends in renewable energy adoption?")
print(result['output'])
```

### Team from files

**team.ctx:**
```yaml
context: |
  Research team for analyzing scientific literature.
  The lead delegates to specialists as needed.
forenpc: lead
model: qwen3.5:2b
provider: ollama
output_format: markdown
max_search_results: 5
mcp_servers:
  - path: ~/.npcsh/mcp_server.py
```

**lead.npc:**
```yaml
#!/usr/bin/env npc
name: lead
primary_directive: |
  You lead the research team. Delegate literature searches to @searcher,
  data analysis to @analyst. Synthesize their findings into a coherent summary.
jinxes:
  - {{ Jinx('sh') }}
  - {{ Jinx('python') }}
  - {{ Jinx('delegate') }}
  - {{ Jinx('web_search') }}
```

**searcher.npc:**
```yaml
#!/usr/bin/env npc
name: searcher
primary_directive: |
  You search for scientific papers and extract key findings.
  Use web_search and load_file to find and read papers.
model: gemini-2.5-flash
provider: gemini
jinxes:
  - {{ Jinx('web_search') }}
  - {{ Jinx('load_file') }}
  - {{ Jinx('sh') }}
```

**Jinxes can reference a specific NPC** to always run under that persona, and **access `ctx` variables** from `team.ctx`:

**jinxes/search_and_summarize.jinx:**
```yaml
#!/usr/bin/env npc
jinx_name: search_and_summarize
description: Search for papers and summarize findings using the searcher NPC.
npc: {{ NPC('searcher') }}
inputs:
  - query
steps:
  - name: search
    engine: natural
    code: |
      Search for papers about {{ query }}.
      Return up to {{ ctx.max_search_results }} results.
  - name: summarize
    engine: natural
    code: |
      Summarize the findings in {{ ctx.output_format }} format:
      {{ output }}
```

The `npc:` field binds the jinx to a specific NPC — when this jinx runs, it always uses the `searcher` persona regardless of which NPC invoked it. Any custom keys in `team.ctx` (like `output_format`, `max_search_results`) are available as `{{ ctx.key }}` in Jinja templates and as `context['key']` in Python steps.

```

`.npc` and `.jinx` files are directly executable:
```bash
./npc_team/lead.npc "summarize the latest arxiv papers on transformers"
./npc_team/jinxes/lib/sh.jinx bash_command="echo hello"
```

### MCP server integration

Add MCP servers to your team for external tool access:

**team.ctx:**
```yaml
forenpc: assistant
mcp_servers:
  - path: ./tools/db_server.py
  - path: ./tools/api_server.py
```

**db_server.py:**
```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Database Tools")

@mcp.tool()
def query_orders(customer_id: str, limit: int = 10) -> str:
    """Query recent orders for a customer."""
    # Your database logic here
    return f"Found {limit} orders for customer {customer_id}"

@mcp.tool()
def search_products(query: str) -> str:
    """Search the product catalog."""
    return f"Products matching: {query}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

The team's NPCs automatically get access to MCP tools alongside their jinxes.

### Agent definitions in markdown

**agents.md** — multiple agents in one file:
```markdown
## summarizer
You summarize long documents into concise bullet points.
Focus on key findings, methodology, and conclusions.

## fact_checker
You verify claims against reliable sources and flag inaccuracies.
Always cite your sources.
```

**agents/translator.md** — one file per agent with optional frontmatter:
```markdown
---
model: gemini-2.5-flash
provider: gemini
---
You translate content between languages while preserving tone and idiom.
```

### Skills

Skills are knowledge-content jinxes that provide instructional sections to agents on demand.

**npc_team/jinxes/skills/code-review/SKILL.md:**
```markdown
---
name: code-review
description: Use when reviewing code for quality, security, and best practices.
---
# Code Review Skill

## checklist
- Check for security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- Verify error handling and edge cases
- Review naming conventions and code clarity

## security
Focus on OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities...
```

Reference in your NPC:
```yaml
jinxes:
  - {{ Jinx('skills/code-review') }}
```

### CLI tools

```bash
# The NPC shell — the recommended way to use NPC teams
npcsh                        # Interactive shell with agents, tools, and jinxes

# Scaffold a new team
npc-init

# Launch AI coding tools as an NPC from your team
npc-claude --npc corca       # Claude Code
npc-codex --npc analyst      # Codex
npc-gemini                   # Gemini CLI (interactive picker)
npc-opencode / npc-aider / npc-amp

# Register MCP server + hooks for deeper integration
npc-plugin claude
```

### Knowledge graphs

Build, evolve, and search knowledge graphs from text. The KG grows through waking (assimilation), sleeping (consolidation), and dreaming (speculative synthesis).

```python
from npcpy.memory.knowledge_graph import (
    kg_initial, kg_evolve_incremental, kg_sleep_process,
    kg_dream_process, kg_hybrid_search,
)
from npcpy.data.load_file import load_file_contents

# Seed the KG from a design doc PDF and a migration script
design_doc = load_file_contents("docs/auth_migration_plan.pdf")
migration_sql = load_file_contents("migrations/003_clerk_auth.sql")

kg = kg_initial(
    content=design_doc + "\n\n" + migration_sql,
    model="qwen3:4b", provider="ollama",
)

# Assimilate follow-up commits and PR descriptions
kg, _ = kg_evolve_incremental(
    kg,
    new_content_text=(
        "PR #412: Replaced Stripe customer-session lookup with Clerk JWT verification. "
        "Removed /api/stripe/webhook endpoint. Added ClerkMiddleware to all protected routes. "
        "CSP headers updated to allow clerk.accounts.dev origin."
    ),
    model="qwen3:4b", provider="ollama", get_concepts=True,
)

kg, _ = kg_evolve_incremental(
    kg,
    new_content_text=(
        "PR #418: Fixed GraphQL resolver auth context — clerkUserId now propagated "
        "through dataloader chain. Added integration tests for nested query auth."
    ),
    model="qwen3:4b", provider="ollama", get_concepts=True,
)

# Consolidate — merge redundant nodes, strengthen high-frequency edges
kg, sleep_report = kg_sleep_process(kg, model="qwen3:4b", provider="ollama")

# Dream — generate speculative connections between loosely related concepts
kg, dream_report = kg_dream_process(kg, model="qwen3:4b", provider="ollama")

# Search across facts, concepts, and speculative edges
results = kg_hybrid_search(kg, "How does auth propagate through GraphQL resolvers?",
                           model="qwen3:4b", provider="ollama")
for r in results:
    print(r['score'], r['text'])
print(f"{len(kg['facts'])} facts, {len(kg['concepts'])} concepts")
```

### Memory extraction

Extract structured memories from conversations with a self-improving quality loop.

```python
from npcpy.llm_funcs import get_facts

conversation = """
User: We're ripping out Stripe entirely and moving auth to Clerk. The JWT verification
      will happen in ClerkMiddleware instead of the custom verify_stripe_session helper.
Assistant: Got it. I'll update the middleware chain. What about the existing session store?
User: Kill the Redis session cache — Clerk handles session state on their end.
      Also, the CSP headers need clerk.accounts.dev and clerk.enpisi.com added to connect-src.
Assistant: Makes sense. Should I keep the rate limiter on /api/auth endpoints?
User: Switch it from the per-session token bucket to a per-IP sliding window.
      The Stripe webhook endpoint at /api/stripe/webhook can be deleted entirely.
Assistant: Will do. I'll also remove the STRIPE_SECRET_KEY from the env template.
"""

facts = get_facts(conversation, model="qwen3:4b", provider="ollama")
for f in facts:
    print(f"[{f.get('category', 'general')}] {f['statement']}")
# [architecture] Auth provider migrated from Stripe to Clerk with JWT verification via ClerkMiddleware
# [infrastructure] Redis session cache removed — Clerk manages session state
# [security] CSP connect-src updated to include clerk.accounts.dev and clerk.enpisi.com
# [architecture] Rate limiter changed from per-session token bucket to per-IP sliding window
# [cleanup] /api/stripe/webhook endpoint deleted; STRIPE_SECRET_KEY removed from env template
```

### Sememolution (population-based KG evolution)

Maintain a population of KG variants that evolve independently. Each individual has Poisson-sampled search parameters, producing different traversals each query. Selection pressure from response ranking drives convergence toward useful graph structures.

```python
from pathlib import Path
from npcpy.memory.kg_population import SememolutionPopulation
from npcpy.data.load_file import load_file_contents

pop = SememolutionPopulation(population_size=100, sample_size=10)
pop.initialize()

# Ingest a heterogeneous corpus — PDFs, DOCX, source code, meeting transcripts
corpus_dirs = [Path("docs/architecture"), Path("docs/meeting_notes"), Path("src/auth")]
for d in corpus_dirs:
    for f in sorted(d.glob("*")):
        if f.suffix in (".pdf", ".docx", ".md", ".py", ".ts", ".txt"):
            text = load_file_contents(str(f))
            pop.assimilate_text(text)

# Sleep/dream cycle — each individual consolidates according to its genome
pop.sleep_cycle()

# Query: sample 10 individuals, generate competing responses, rank them
rankings = pop.query_and_rank("How does the auth middleware chain interact with the GraphQL context?")
for rank, entry in enumerate(rankings[:3], 1):
    print(f"#{rank} (individual {entry['id']}, score {entry['score']:.3f}): {entry['response'][:120]}...")

# Selection + reproduction — top performers breed, bottom are replaced
pop.evolve_generation()

stats = pop.get_stats()
print(f"Generation {stats['generation']} | avg fitness {stats['avg_fitness']:.3f} | "
      f"best fitness {stats['best_fitness']:.3f} | diversity {stats['diversity']:.3f}")
```

### Fine-tuning (SFT, RL, MLX)

```python
from npcpy.ft.sft import run_sft

# Train a model to extract structured decisions from meeting notes
# LoRA fine-tuning — auto-uses MLX on Apple Silicon
X_train = [
    "Meeting: Auth Migration Sync (2025-01-15)\nAttendees: Sarah, Mike, Priya\n"
    "Discussion: Evaluated Clerk vs Auth0 for replacing Stripe auth. Clerk chosen "
    "for lower latency and native Next.js support. Migration starts sprint 12. "
    "Redis session store will be removed once Clerk JWT verification is stable.",

    "Meeting: API Rate Limiting Review (2025-01-22)\nAttendees: Mike, Jordan\n"
    "Discussion: Current per-session token bucket is incompatible with Clerk's "

    "Discussion: Production outage caused by missing CSP header for clerk.accounts.dev. "
    "Root cause: deploy script didn't pick up new env vars. Fix: added CSP validation "
    "to CI pipeline. New rule: all external origins must be in csp_allowlist.json.",
]
y_train = [
