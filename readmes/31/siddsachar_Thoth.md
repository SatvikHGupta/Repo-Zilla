Thoth is a **local-first AI assistant built for personal AI sovereignty** — your models, your data, your rules. It combines a powerful ReAct agent with 25 integrated tools (69 sub-operations) — web search, email, calendar, file management, shell access, browser automation, vision, image generation, long-term memory with a personal knowledge graph, **advanced workflows** with conditional branching and approval gates, habit tracking, and more — plus a **plugin system** with a built-in marketplace and a **multi-channel messaging framework** (Telegram with full media support; more channels coming). Run everything locally via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), or add opt-in cloud models from **OpenAI**, **Anthropic** (Claude), **Google AI** (Gemini), **xAI** (Grok), and **OpenRouter** (100+ models) when you need frontier reasoning or don't have a GPU. Either way, your data — conversations, memories, documents, and history — stays on your machine.

> **Local models are already amazing.** You'll be surprised what a 14B+ local model can do. If you start with cloud models today, and as local models get smarter and hardware gets cheaper, transition to fully local, fully private, fully free AI — seamlessly, with no changes to your setup.

> Governments are investing billions to keep AI infrastructure within their borders. Thoth applies the same principle to the individual — your compute, your data, your choice of model, **accountable to no one but you.**

> **🖥️ One-click install on Windows & macOS** — download, run, done. No terminal, no Docker, no config files. [Get it here.](https://github.com/siddsachar/Thoth/releases)

### Why the name "Thoth"?

In ancient Egyptian mythology, **Thoth** (𓁟) was the god of wisdom, writing, and knowledge — the divine scribe who recorded all human understanding. Like its namesake, this tool is built to gather, organize, and faithfully retrieve knowledge — while keeping everything under your control.

---

## ✨ Features

> 📖 Every feature below is documented in full technical detail in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

### 🤖 ReAct Agent Architecture

LangGraph-based autonomous agent with **25 tools / 69 sub-operations** — the agent decides which tools to call, how many times, and in what order. Real-time token streaming with thinking model support (DeepSeek-R1, Qwen3, QwQ — collapsible reasoning bubbles). Smart context management via tiktoken: auto-summarization at 80% capacity, proportional tool-output shrinking, and dynamic tool budgets that adapt to available headroom. Destructive actions require explicit confirmation; orphaned tool calls are auto-repaired; recursive loops are caught with a wind-down warning at 75%.

[Details →](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#react-agent-architecture)

### 🧠 Long-Term Memory & Knowledge Graph

Thoth builds a **personal knowledge graph** — entities (person, place, event, preference, fact, project, organisation, concept, skill, media) linked by 67 typed directional relations with 60+ aliases (`Dad --[father_of]--> User`), with alias resolution, auto-linking on save, memory decay, and background orphan repair. Vague relation types (`related_to`, `associated_with`, etc.) are automatically rejected; relation pre-normalisation ensures consistent naming. The agent can save, search, link, and explore memories through natural conversation. Graph-enhanced auto-recall retrieves semantically similar entities via FAISS and expands 1 hop in the NetworkX graph before every LLM call. An interactive **Knowledge tab** visualizes the full graph with search, entity-type filters, ego-graph toggle, and clickable detail cards. Background extraction produces structured triples with deterministic cross-category dedup; conservative extraction filters skip workflow threads, truncate assistant messages, and apply an 0.80 confidence floor to prevent junk entities.

[Details →](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#long-term-memory--knowledge-graph)

### 📚 Wiki Vault (Obsidian Export)

Export the entire knowledge graph as an **Obsidian-compatible markdown vault** — one `.md` file per entity with YAML frontmatter, `[[wiki-links]]`, and per-type indexes. Entities grouped by type (`wiki/person/`, `wiki/project/`, …); sparse entities roll up into index files. Live export on save/delete, full-text search, and conversation export. The agent has 4 sub-tools (`wiki_read`, `wiki_rebuild`, `wiki_stats`, `wiki_export_conversation`) to interact with the vault directly.

[Details →](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#wiki-vault)

### 🌙 Dream Cycle (Nightly Knowledge Refinement)

A 4-phase background daemon that refines the knowledge graph during idle hours — **merging duplicates** (≥0.93 similarity), **enriching thin descriptions** from conversation context, **inferring missing relationships** between co-occurring entities, and **decaying stale confidence** on relations older than 90 days. Hub diversity caps, batch rotation, and a 7-day rejection cache ensure high-quality, non-repetitive inferences. Three-layer anti-contamination system prevents cross-entity fact-bleed. Ollama busy check defers cycles when the GPU is actively serving a user request. Configurable dream window; all operations logged to an expandable dream journal in the Activity tab. Manual 🌙 Dream button in the Knowledge graph panel.

[Details →](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#dream-cycle)

### 📄 Document Knowledge Extraction

Uploaded documents are processed through a **map-reduce LLM pipeline** that extracts structured knowledge into the graph. Documents are split into windows, summarized, then reduced into a coherent article; core entities and relations are extracted with full source provenance. A curated relation vocabulary (67 types + 60 aliases) eliminates unknown-type warnings; entity caps (12 per document), minimum description length (30 chars), hub entity dedup, and self-loop rejection ensure clean output. Supports PDF, DOCX, TXT, Markdown, HTML, and EPUB. Live progress pill in the status bar with phase indicator and stop button. Per-document cleanup removes vector store entries and all extracted entities.

[Details →](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#document-knowledge-extraction)

### 🤖 Brain Model & Cloud Models

Run **fully local** via Ollama (39 curated tool-calling models) or connect cloud providers — **OpenAI**, **Anthropic** (Claude), **Google AI** (Gemini), **xAI** (Grok), and **OpenRouter** (100+ models) — switchable per-thread and per-task from the GUI. First-launch wizard offers Local or Cloud paths; star favorites for quick access; cloud vision models are auto-detected. Privacy controls disable memory extraction and auto-recall for cloud threads. Smart context trimming reduces token usage and cloud API costs.

[Details →](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#brain-model--cloud-models)

### 🎤 Voice Input & 🔊 Text-to-Speech

Toggle-based voice input with local **faster-whisper** STT (4 model sizes, CPU-only int8) — no cloud APIs. Neural TTS via **Kokoro** with 10 voices (US/British, male/female), streaming sentence-by-sentence with automatic mic gating during playback. Combine both for a fully hands-free conversational experience.

[Details →](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#voice-input--text-to-speech)

### 🖥️ Shell Access

Full shell access with **3-tier safety** — safe commands (`ls`, `git status`) auto-execute, moderate commands (`rm`, `pip install`) require confirmation, dangerous commands (`shutdown`, `reboot`, `mkfs`) are blocked outright. Enhanced destructive-command detection for workflow safety-mode integration. Persistent sessions per thread, inline terminal panel, command history saved to disk. Background tasks and workflows support per-task command prefix allowlists.

[Details →](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#shell-access)

### 🌐 Browser Automation

Autonomous browsing in a **visible Chromium window** — navigate, click, type, scroll, and manage tabs through natural conversation. Accessibility-tree snapshots with numbered element references; per-thread tab isolation; persistent login profile; smart snapshot compression for context efficiency; crash recovery and automatic browser detection (Chrome → Edge → Playwright).

[Details →](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#browser-automation)

### 👁️ Vision

Camera capture, screen capture, and **workspace image file analysis** via local or cloud vision models. Cloud models with vision capability (GPT-4o, Claude) are auto-detected. Images displayed inline in chat; configurable vision model selection.

[Details →](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#vision)

### ⚡ Workflows & Scheduling

Advanced **workflow engine** powered by APScheduler with 7 schedule types (daily, weekly, weekdays, weekends, interval, cron, one-shot delay) and a full **step-based pipeline builder**. Five step types — Prompt, Condition, Approval, Subtask, and Notify — with conditional `if_true`/`if_false` branching, approval gates that pause for human decisions, webhook triggers, task-completion triggers, concurrency groups, and per-workflow safety mode (block destructive, require approval, or allow all). Template variables (`{{date}}`, `{{time}}`, `{{step.X.output}}`), channel delivery (Telegram/Email), per-task model override, and configurable background permissions. A redesigned workflow builder UI offers simple and advanced modes with a visual Mermaid flow preview. Pending approvals surface in the sidebar with badge counts and quick-approve buttons.

[Details →](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#workflows--scheduling)

### 📬 Messaging Channels

A generic **Channel ABC** lets any messaging platform plug into Thoth — channels declare capabilities (photo, voice, documents, reactions, buttons) and the system auto-generates tools and settings UI for each one. **Telegram** is the first full-featured channel: inbound voice transcription (faster-whisper), photo analysis (Vision), document handling with text extraction (PDF/CSV/JSON), emoji reactions (👀/👍/💔) for real-time status, inline keyboard buttons for interrupt approval, multi-channel approval routing for workflow approval gates, safety mode enforcement, and image generation delivery. The agent can proactively send messages, photos, and documents to any registered channel.

[Details →](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#messaging-channels)

### 🖼️ Image Generation

Generate and edit images via **OpenAI**, **xAI** (Grok Imagine), and **Google** (Imagen 4, Nano Banana) — rendered inline in chat and delivered to Telegram. Supports OpenAI (`gpt-image-1`, `gpt-image-1.5`, `gpt-image-1-mini`), xAI (`grok-imagine-image`), and Google (`imagen-4.0-generate-001`, Gemini image models) with configurable size and quality. Edit existing images by referencing the last generation, a pasted attachment, or a file path. Per-provider model picker in Settings → Models.

[Details →](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#image-generation)

### 🔌 Plugin System & Marketplace

A sandboxed, hot-reloadable **plugin architecture** lets anyone add new tools and skills without touching core code. Plugins declare metadata in `plugin.json`, are security-scanned (no `eval`/`exec`/`subprocess`), and run in a dependency-safe sandbox. A built-in **marketplace** lets users browse, install, update, and uninstall plugins from a curated GitHub-hosted catalog. Plugin settings, API keys, enable/disable toggles, and per-plugin config dialogs are all managed from Settings → Plugins.

[Details →](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#plugin-system--marketplace)

### 📋 Habit & Health Tracker

Conversational tracking for medications, symptoms, exercise, periods, mood, sleep — *"I took my Lexapro"*, *"Headache level 6"*. Auto-detection with confirmation; 7 built-in analyses (adherence, streaks, numeric stats, trends, co-occurrence, cycle estimation); CSV export chains to Plotly charts. All data in local SQLite, excluded from the memory system.

[Details →](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#habit--health-tracker)

### 🖥️ Desktop App

Native window via **pywebview** with system tray, splash screen, right-click context menu, and auto-restart. First-launch setup wizard (Local or Cloud). Self-contained one-click installers for **Windows** (Inno Setup) and **macOS** (.app with code signing + notarization) — CI/CD pipeline automates builds, signing, and GitHub Releases.

[Details →](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#desktop-app)

### 💬 Chat & Conversations

Multi-turn threads with LangGraph checkpointer, auto-naming, per-thread model switching, and export (Markdown, text, PDF via Playwright). Attach images, PDFs, CSV, Excel, JSON — plus clipboard paste and drag-and-drop. **File-on-disk media storage** with two-tier persistence — generated content survives thread deletion, transient captures cleaned up automatically. **Auto-scroll** follows streaming output with user-override (scroll up to pause, new message re-engages). Inline rendering: **Plotly charts**, **Mermaid diagrams** (flowchart, sequence, state, ER, Gantt, mindmap), **YouTube embeds**, and syntax-highlighted code. **Status monitor panel** with animated avatar, 17 health-check pills, OAuth token monitoring, and one-click diagnosis. Streaming robustness improvements replace silent failures with debug logging.

[Details →](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#chat--conversations)

### 🔔 Notifications

Desktop notifications, distinct audio chimes (task completion, timer alerts), and contextual in-app toasts — success auto-dismisses, errors persist as red banners. Unified `notify()` call across all channels.

[Details →](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#notifications)

## 💻 System Requirements

### For Local Models (Ollama)

| | Minimum | Recommended |
|--|---------|-------------|
| **OS** | Windows 10/11 (64-bit) or macOS 12+ (Apple Silicon & Intel) | Same |
| **Python** | 3.11+ | 3.11+ |
| **RAM** | 8 GB (for 8B models) | 16–32 GB (for 14B–30B models) |
| **GPU** | Not required — Ollama runs on CPU | NVIDIA 8+ GB VRAM (CUDA) or Apple Silicon — dramatically faster |
| **Disk** | ~5 GB (app + one small model like `qwen3:8b`) | 20+ GB for multiple or larger models |
| **Internet** | Required for install and model download; optional at runtime | Same |

> **Note:** The default local model (`qwen3:14b`, ~9 GB) runs well on CPU with 16 GB RAM, but a GPU makes responses significantly faster. Smaller models like `qwen3:8b` (~5 GB) work on 8 GB RAM machines.

### For Cloud Models Only (No Local GPU Needed)

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **OS** | Windows 10/11 (64-bit) or macOS 12+ (Apple Silicon & Intel) |
| **Python** | 3.11+ |
| **RAM** | 4 GB |
| **Disk** | ~1 GB (app + packages, no model downloads) |
| **GPU** | Not needed |
| **Internet** | Required (LLM inference happens on the provider's servers) |

> You still need an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/), [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/), [Google AI](https://aistudio.google.com/), [xAI](https://console.x.ai/), or [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/). Cloud models are billed per-token by the provider — typically pennies per conversation.

## 📥 One-Click Install

### Windows

1. Download **[ThothSetup_3.14.0.exe](https://github.com/siddsachar/Thoth/releases/latest)** from the latest release
2. Run the installer — it installs Python, Ollama, and all dependencies automatically
3. Launch **Thoth** from the Start Menu or Desktop shortcut

### macOS

1. Download **[Thoth-3.14.0-macOS-arm64.dmg](https://github.com/siddsachar/Thoth/releases/latest)** from the latest release
2. Open the DMG and drag **Thoth.app** into the **Applications** folder
3. Launch **Thoth** from Applications or Launchpad
   - First run may prompt "Thoth is an app downloaded from the internet" → click **Open**
   - First run installs Homebrew (if needed), Python, Ollama, and all dependencies automatically
   - Subsequent launches skip installation and start in ~3 seconds

> **Works on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) and Intel Macs** (macOS 12+). No terminal, no manual setup — just double-click and go.

> **Using cloud models only?** The installer still sets up Ollama by default, but you can skip model downloads. On first launch, choose the **Cloud** setup path, enter your API key, and start chatting — no GPU required.

---

## 📦 Installation (From Source)

> **Prefer a manual install?** A few commands from source:

1. **Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)** *(required for local models — skip if using cloud models only)*

2. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/siddsachar/Thoth.git
   cd Thoth
   ```

3. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # macOS / Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Start Ollama** *(if using local models)*
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```

6. **Launch Thoth**
   ```bash
   python launcher.py
   ```
   This starts the system tray icon and opens the app at `http://localhost:8080`.

   Alternatively, run directly without the tray:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

> **First launch:** A setup wizard lets you choose between **Local** (Ollama) and **Cloud** (API key) setup paths. For local, the default brain model (`qwen3:14b`, ~9 GB) is recommended. For cloud, enter your API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, xAI, or OpenRouter) and pick a default model.

## 🔑 API Key Setup (Optional)

Most tools work without any API keys. For cloud models and enhanced functionality:

### Cloud LLM Providers

| Service | Key | Purpose | How to Get |
|---------|-----|---------|------------|
| **OpenAI** | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | GPT and other OpenAI models | [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/) |
| **Anthropic** | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Claude models (direct API) | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/) |
| **Google AI** | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Gemini models (direct API) | [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/) |
| **xAI** | `XAI_API_KEY` | Grok models (direct API) | [console.x.ai](https://console.x.ai/) |
| **OpenRouter** | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | 100+ models from all major providers (Claude, Gemini, Llama, etc.) | [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/) |

Configure cloud keys in **⚙️ Settings → ☁️ Cloud** tab. Keys are stored locally in `~/.thoth/cloud_config.json` — never sent to Thoth's servers (there are none).

### Tool API Keys

| Service | Key | Purpose | How to Get |
|---------|-----|---------|------------|
| **Tavily** | `TAVILY_API_KEY` | Web search (1,000 free searches/month) | [app.tavily.com](https://app.tavily.com/) |
| **Wolfram Alpha** | `WOLFRAM_ALPHA_APPID` | Advanced computation & scientific data | [developer.wolframalpha.com](https://developer.wolframalpha.com/) |

Configure tool keys in **⚙️ Settings → 🔍 Search** tab. Keys are saved locally to `~/.thoth/api_keys.json`.

For **Gmail** and **Google Calendar**, you'll need a Google Cloud OAuth `credentials.json` — setup instructions are provided in the respective Settings tabs.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Local Models (Default)

1. **Launch Thoth** and wait for the default model to download (first time only)
2. **Click "＋ New conversation"** in the sidebar
3. **Ask anything** — the agent will automatically choose which tools to use:
   - *"What's the weather in Tokyo?"* → uses Weather tool
   - *"Search for recent papers on transformer architectures"* → uses Arxiv
   - *"Remember that my mom's birthday is March 15"* → saves to Memory
   - *"Read the file report.pdf in my workspace"* → uses Filesystem
   - *"Run git status on my project"* → uses Shell (safe, auto-executes)
   - *"Install pandas with pip"* → uses Shell (moderate, asks for approval)
   - *"What's on my screen right now?"* → uses Vision (screen capture)
   - *"I took my Lexapro"* → asks to log, then saves to Tracker
   - *"Show my headache trends this month"* → uses Tracker + Chart
   - *"Remind me to call the dentist tomorrow at 9am"* → uses Tasks with scheduling
   - *"What did I ask about taxes last week?"* → uses Conversation Search
4. **Open ⚙️ Settings** to configure models, enable/disable tools, and set up integrations

### Cloud Models (No GPU? Start Here)

1. **Launch Thoth** → on the setup wizard, choose **☁️ Cloud**
2. **Enter your API key** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, xAI, or OpenRouter) → Thoth validates and fetches available models
3. **Pick a default model** (e.g. GPT) and start chatting — no downloads, no GPU needed
4. Switch models per conversation anytime from the chat header dropdown

## 🔒 Privacy & Security — Personal AI Sovereignty

**Local models (default):** All LLM inference runs on your machine via Ollama. Documents, memories, and conversations stored locally in `~/.thoth/`. External network calls only when using online tools (web search, Gmail, Calendar) — each individually disableable. No telemetry, no tracking.

**Cloud models (opt-in):** Only the current conversation is sent to the LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, xAI, or OpenRouter). Memories, knowledge graph, documents, files, and other conversations never leave your machine. Your API key connects directly to the provider — Thoth has no servers and no middleman.

**Always:** API keys stored locally; no Thoth account required; no sign-up; no server to phone home to. Tools can be individually disabled to control what the agent can access.
