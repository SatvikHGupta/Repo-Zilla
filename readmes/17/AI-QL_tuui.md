This repository is essentially an **LLM chat desktop application based on MCP**. It also represents a bold experiment in **creating a complete project using AI**. Many components within the project have been directly converted or generated from the prototype project through AI.

Given the considerations regarding the quality and safety of AI-generated content, this project employs strict syntax checks and naming conventions. Therefore, for any further development, please ensure that you use the linting tools I've set up to check and automatically fix syntax issues.

- To `download` and use the application directly, go to the releases page: [Releases](https://github.com/AI-QL/tuui/releases/latest)

- For `developer` setup, refer to the installation guide: [Getting Started (English)](docs/src/en/installation-and-build/getting-started.md) | [快速入门 (中文)](docs/src/zhHans/installation-and-build/getting-started.md)

- To `ask the AI` directly about the project, visit: [TUUI@DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/AI-QL/tuui)

## ⚙️ Core Requirements

**To use MCP-related features, ensure the following preconditions are met for your environment:**

- Set up an LLM backend (e.g., `ChatGPT`, `Claude`, `Qwen` or self-hosted) that supports tool/function calling.

- For NPX/NODE-based servers: Install `Node.js` to execute JavaScript/TypeScript tools.

- For UV/UVX-based servers: Install `Python` and the `UV` library.

- For Docker-based servers: Install `DockerHub`.

- For macOS/Linux systems: Modify the default MCP configuration (e.g., adjust CLI paths or permissions).
  > Refer to the [MCP Server Issue](#mcp-server-issue) documentation for guidance

For guidance on configuring the LLM, refer to the template(i.e.: Qwen):

```json
{
  "name": "Qwen",
  "apiKey": "",
  "url": "https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode",
  "path": "/v1/chat/completions",
  "model": "qwen-turbo",
  "modelList": ["qwen-turbo", "qwen-plus", "qwen-max"],
  "maxTokensValue": "",
  "mcp": true
}
```

The configuration accepts either a JSON object (for a single chatbot) or a JSON array (for multiple chatbots):

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Openrouter && Proxy",
    "apiKey": "",
    "url": "https://api3.aiql.com",
    "urlList": ["https://api3.aiql.com", "https://openrouter.ai/api"],
    "path": "/v1/chat/completions",
    "model": "openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
    "modelList": [
      "openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
      "openai/gpt-4.1",
      "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4",
      "google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview"
    ],
    "maxTokensValue": "",
    "mcp": true
  },
  {
    "name": "DeepInfra",
    "apiKey": "",
    "url": "https://api.deepinfra.com",
    "path": "/v1/openai/chat/completions",
    "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B",
    "modelList": [
      "Qwen/Qwen3-32B",
      "Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B",
      "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct"
    ],
    "mcp": true
  }
]
```

### 📕 Additional Configuration

| Configuration | Description | Location | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LLM Endpoints | Default LLM Chatbots config | [llm.json](/src/main/assets/config/llm.json) | Full config types could be found in [llm.d.ts](/src/preload/llm.d.ts) |
| MCP Servers | Default MCP servers configs | [mcp.json](/src/main/assets/config/mcp.json) | For configuration syntax, see [MCP Servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers?tab=readme-ov-file#using-an-mcp-client) |
| Startup Screen | Default News on Startup Screen | [startup.json](/src/main/assets/config/startup.json) |  |
| Popup Screen | Default Prompts on Startup Screen | [popup.json](/src/main/assets/config/popup.json) |  |

For the decomposable package, you can also modify the default configuration of the built release:

For example, `src/main/assets/config/llm.json` will be located in `resources/assets/config/llm.json`

Once you modify or import the configurations, it will be stored in your `localStorage` by default.

Alternatively, you can clear all configurations from the `Tray Menu` by selecting `Clear Storage`.

## 🌐 Remote MCP server

You can utilize Cloudflare's recommended [mcp-remote](https://github.com/geelen/mcp-remote) to implement the full suite of remote MCP server functionalities (including Auth). For example, simply add the following to your [mcp.json](src/main/assets/config/mcp.json) file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cloudflare": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://YOURDOMAIN.com/sse"]
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, I have provided a test remote server: `https://YOURDOMAIN.com` on [Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/remote-model-context-protocol-servers-mcp/). This server will always approve your authentication requests.

If you encounter any issues (please try to maintain OAuth auto-redirect to prevent callback delays that might cause failures), such as the common HTTP 400 error. You can resolve them by clearing your browser cache on the authentication page and then attempting verification again:

## 🚸 MCP Server Issue

### General

When launching the MCP server, if you encounter any issues, first ensure that the corresponding command can run on your current system — for example, `uv`/`uvx`, `npx`, etc.

### ENOENT Spawn Errors

When launching the MCP server, if you encounter spawn errors like `ENOENT`, try running the corresponding MCP server locally and invoking it using an absolute path.

If the command works but MCP initialization still returns spawn errors, this may be a known issue:

- **Windows**: The MCP SDK includes a workaround specifically for `Windows` systems, as documented in [ISSUE 101](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/issues/101).

  > Details: [ISSUE 40 - MCP servers fail to connect with npx on Windows](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/issues/40) (fixed)

- **mscOS**: The issue remains unresolved on other platforms, specifically `macOS`. Although several workarounds are available, this ticket consolidates the most effective ones and highlights the simplest method: [How to configure MCP on macOS](https://github.com/AI-QL/tuui/issues/2).

  > Details: [ISSUE 64 - MCP Servers Don't Work with NVM](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/issues/64) (still open)

### MCP Connection Timeout

If initialization takes too long and triggers the 90-second timeout protection, it may be because the `uv`/`uvx`/`npx` runtime libraries are being installed or updated for the first time.

When your connection to the respective `pip` or `npm` repository is slow, installation can take a long time.

In such cases, first complete the installation manually with `pip` or `npm` in the relevant directory, and then start the MCP server again.
